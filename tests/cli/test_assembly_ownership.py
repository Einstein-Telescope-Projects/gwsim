"""Two implementations could place signals into segments; this pins that they agree.

``gwmock_signal.jax_batch.assemble_segments`` scatters a batch into a fixed tiling of segments in
memory, given every segment start up front. gwmock assembles differently by necessity: it streams,
holding one segment at a time, claiming events for it and carrying the overflow forward as a tail.

gwmock owns assembly and does not call ``assemble_segments`` -- the batched path is a different way
to *generate*, not a different way to assemble. That decision is recorded in
:meth:`~gwmock.cli.adapter_orchestration.AdapterOrchestrator._simulate_batched_segment`, and it is
the reason this file exists rather than a deduplication: two assemblers stay in the ecosystem, so
the risk is that they drift while both keep producing plausible segments. Nothing about a wrong
segment looks wrong.

So the guard is an equivalence measurement rather than a shared implementation. Same events, both
assemblers, compared sample by sample.

**The two do not agree bit-for-bit, and the reason is generation rather than assembly.** Each path
generates its own batch -- gwmock per segment, the scatter once for the catalogue -- and a JAX batch
is padded to its longest event, so the same event is computed at different batch shapes and the FFTs
differ in their last bits. That makes the residue catalogue-dependent, which is why a mixed-mass case
is tested explicitly rather than assumed to behave like the uniform one.

    The tolerance admits generation-side noise and nothing more, and what produces that noise is
    worth stating because the obvious explanation is wrong. It is **not** the grid anchor: generating
    the same event on a grid at the run start and on one at the third segment's start is
