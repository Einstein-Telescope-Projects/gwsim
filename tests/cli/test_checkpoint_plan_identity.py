"""A checkpoint must say which configuration wrote it, and a resume must check.

Measured before this existed: two configs run from one working directory, the first interrupted
after two of three batches. The second **loaded the first's checkpoint, skipped those batches as
already complete, and wrote one frame where a clean run writes three** — exit code 0, no warning.
Silent data loss from an ordinary action, since every shipped example puts `.gwmock_checkpoints` and
`metadata/` relative to the working directory.

`_batch_outputs_present` does not catch it, and cannot: it looks up
``{simulator_name}-{batch_index}.metadata.json`` — a name with nothing config-specific in it — and
then verifies the outputs *that file* records. The first run's metadata records the first run's
frames, which exist, so the check passes on one run's evidence while a different run is executing.

The refusal is deliberate rather than a silent fresh start: ignoring the foreign checkpoint would fix
the data loss and hide its cause, leaving a stale checkpoint in place and an unexplained full re-run.
