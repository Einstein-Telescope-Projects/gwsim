"""Continuous waves through the orchestrator, against the real waveform backend.

What is here is only what a real backend can establish: that the phase joins up across a segment
boundary, and that two pulsars compose into their sum. Both are physical claims about generated
strain, and a fake backend asserting either would be asserting its own arithmetic.

The load-bearing test is :meth:`TestPhaseCoherence.test_segments_join_up_through_the_orchestrator`.
The simulator guarantees coherence only if ``reference_time_ssb`` reaches it as one value for the
whole run; plumbing that derived it per segment would produce frames that look entirely normal and
are useless to a coherent search.

This module needs ``ripplegw`` and the LALPulsar ephemeris tables, and it **does** run in CI: the
`test-jax` job installs the extra, caches the tables and verifies them against
``tests/data/ephemeris.sha256``. It used to skip when they were absent, which on a fresh runner was
always, so it ran nowhere while the suite reported green. There is no skip gate now -- absent
tables fail.

Everything that does *not* need a waveform lives in ``test_continuous_wave_wiring.py``, which runs
in the default job too: routing, the refusals, the ordering exemption and its source-type gate,
provenance, and that the population index never advances. Put a wiring-level test there rather than
here, so it is covered without the optional extra.
