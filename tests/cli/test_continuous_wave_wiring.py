"""The continuous-wave branch of the orchestrator, exercised without a waveform library.

``test_continuous_wave_orchestration.py`` covers the same branch against the real backend, which is
where phase coherence and the numerical composition are established. That module needs ``ripplegw``
and the LALPulsar ephemeris tables, so it runs in the `test-jax` job rather than the default one.

This module runs everywhere, which is the point of separating them: the wiring is covered without
the optional extra, and only claims that need real strain depend on it.

What is checked here is the wiring: which route a `cw` configuration takes, what it refuses, what
it records, and that the catalogue is summed rather than overwritten. None of that involves a
waveform, so a fake signal backend serves. The fake returns ``background + a per-source constant``,
which makes the expected total exact and any composition error a mismatch rather than a tolerance
question.

Deliberately not covered here: anything about the *signal*. A fake backend cannot show that the
phase joins up across a segment boundary, and a test here that appeared to would be lying.
