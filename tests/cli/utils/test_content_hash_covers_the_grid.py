"""The content hash must notice a change of grid, in every format a run can write.

The digest folds each channel's samples together with the scalar metadata that says *where* those
samples sit -- epoch, sample interval, length. The GWF branch always recorded those; the HDF5 branch
recorded none of them, so two HDF5 files holding identical samples at different GPS times, or at
different sample rates, produced the same hash. Measured, both collided.

That asymmetry was survivable while HDF5 was the secondary format. It is not now that HDF5 is what a run
writes by default, because the weaker check would become the one every user gets.

These tests are parametrised over both formats deliberately: the point is not that HDF5 works, it is that
the two answer the same question.
