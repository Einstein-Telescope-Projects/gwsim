"""Events whose waveform has finished before the segment starts, and the batch they inflate.

The companion to :mod:`tests.cli.test_inspiral_segment_placement`, from the other side. That
module pins the *upper* bound: a segment claims an event whose waveform starts before the segment
ends, so an inspiral is not cropped. The rule has no lower bound, and the omission is invisible in
a sequential run -- earlier segments have already consumed the earlier events, so the walk starts
past them.

It is not invisible in a run whose ``start-time`` is later than its population's first event.
Nothing has consumed those events, every one of them satisfies "starts before this segment ends",
and the first segment claims the entire back catalogue. **Measured on the shipped ET config:** a
run starting 53 ks into the catalogue batched 126 events where the segment contains 13, estimated
12.5 GiB, and was refused by the preflight; at 41 ks it batched 98 for 16; at 4 ks, 19 for 8. The
batch tracks the offset rather than the local event density. Their samples are then cropped as
out-of-segment, so the work is generated and discarded.

Resuming a campaign mid-catalogue, or slicing a long population into per-day jobs, is exactly this.

**Why the fix cannot be another clause in the same predicate.** Both loops ``break`` on the first
event that does not belong, and ``population_index`` -- checkpointed state meaning "every event
before this one is consumed" -- advances by the count of events consumed. An early event answering
"does not belong" would therefore stop the walk at position 0 and consume nothing, and it would do
so again on every following segment: the run would stall permanently rather than over-batch. An
event that has finished must be *skipped and consumed*, which is a different operation from the
one the upper bound performs, and ``test_a_finished_event_does_not_stop_the_walk`` is what pins
the difference.

``None`` from the query means unknown, and unknown must claim. The query exists to let a caller
*prove* an event is finished; on no answer the conservative branch is the one that generates the
event and lets injection crop it, because the alternative silently deletes signal.
