"""A resumed run must place the tail of a signal that crosses the resume point.

Measured on ``main`` with a 1.6+1.4 binary from 30 Hz across 32 s segments: interrupt after the
first batch checkpoints, re-run the same config, and the third frame -- the one holding the
**merger** -- comes back at a peak of exactly ``0.0`` against ``7.280e-23`` uninterrupted. The two
frames before it are bit-identical, so nothing about the run looks wrong; the loudest part of the
signal is simply absent.

The cause is that spillover lived only in memory. ``cached_data_chunks`` holds the part of a chunk
extending past the segment being built, and it was neither a ``StateAttribute`` nor saved anywhere
else, so a resumed process started with none of it.

Two things had to be right, and they fail independently:

* the checkpoint has to carry the chunks at all, and carry their ``metadata`` with them -- restoring
  the samples while dropping ``injection_parameters`` and ``event_id`` would look like a fix while
  losing the provenance the frames are indexed by;
* ``restore_batch_state`` has to put them back on the simulator.
