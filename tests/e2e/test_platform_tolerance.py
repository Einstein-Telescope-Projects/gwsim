"""The one entry-and-platform relaxation in the reference gate, and its limits.

An entry that generates through LALSimulation does not reproduce across processor
architectures: replayed on Darwin/arm64 against these Linux/x86_64 references, the two such
entries move by 3.90e-06 and 4.17e-06 of peak, while every other entry stays at 8.0e-13 or
below and the Python version moves nothing at all. The difference is present in LAL's own
frequency-domain output before any code in this project runs, so the comparison relaxes for
those entries rather than pretending the run is wrong.

Not marked ``e2e``: none of this needs a generation run, and the relaxation is exactly the kind
of thing that should be checked on every pull request rather than in the job that runs for
minutes. What it guards is a gate getting quietly wider -- the flag spreading to entries that
never touch LAL, the loose bound leaking onto the platform that wrote the reference, or the
integer statistics being swept along with the floats.
