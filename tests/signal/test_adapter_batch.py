"""Tests for the batched (on-device) entry point on the gwmock-side adapter.

gwmock's orchestration generates one event at a time: ``cli/adapter_orchestration.py`` loops over
population events calling ``simulate``, producing a strain per event. That is the only shape the
LAL and PyCBC backends offer, and it is why gwmock could not run a GPU simulation at all — the
batched path in gwmock-signal had no caller here.

``simulate_segments`` is the batched counterpart: catalogue in as a struct-of-arrays, assembled
segments out. It is deliberately a *second* entry point rather than a change to ``simulate_stack``,
because the per-event path has to keep working unchanged for backends with no batched form.

The tests that actually generate waveforms need the ``[jax]`` extra and are skipped without it; the
input-handling tests do not, and run everywhere.
