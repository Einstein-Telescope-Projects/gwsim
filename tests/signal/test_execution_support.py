"""Refusing settings the chosen execution path would ignore.

Three bugs in the batched path shared one shape: a setting was read from the configuration and never
forwarded to the generator, so the run produced plausible output while quietly disregarding what it
had been told.

The fix is not a fourth special case but an inverted default: the batched path declares what it
honours, and anything else the user set is refused. A configuration key added later therefore fails
loudly there until someone wires it.
