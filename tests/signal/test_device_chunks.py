"""Converting batched device output into gwmock chunks.

The conversion is pure host-side arithmetic on placement and ordering, so almost all of it is tested
against a stub batch rather than a real device run: that keeps the guards covered in an installation
without the ``[jax]`` extra, and it lets the failure cases be constructed deliberately instead of
hoped for. One test at the end runs the real batched path to check the stub has the right shape.
