) -> str:
    """Identify a run by everything that decides where its outputs go, not just its config file.

    The config file hash alone is not the run. Two invocations of the *same* file with different
    ``--output-dir`` produce identical hashes, so a checkpoint from the first is accepted by the
    second, which then skips the batches it records and writes nothing for them into the new
    directory -- measured at 2 frames where a clean run writes 3. That is the bug the fingerprint
    exists to stop, arriving through a different door.

    The output and metadata directories are resolved, so ``./out`` and an absolute path to the same
    place are one run rather than two, and a relative path is not mistaken for a different one when
    the working directory changes.

    Every batch's config hash goes in, not the first: a plan assembled from several metadata records
    can mix configurations, and taking one of them would let the rest through unchecked.

    **Two things it does not cover, both verified in review rather than assumed.**

    *Cosmetic edits refuse a valid resume.* The hash is over config bytes, so adding a comment or
    reindenting changes it and a legitimate resume is turned away. Annoying, and the safe direction;
    ``--ignore-checkpoint`` is the way out.

    **The population file is covered by content, not just by name.** A config names its catalogue by
    path, so replacing that file's bytes left every part of this identity unchanged: the checkpoint was
    accepted and the batches it recorded were skipped, giving one run some batches from the old
    catalogue and the rest from the new one. Measured before fixing -- a 3-batch run interrupted after
    the first batch and resumed over a rewritten CSV kept mass 30 in batch 0 while batches 1 and 2
    carried 81 and 82, exit code 0. Hashing it costs 18 ms for a 45 MB million-row catalogue, against a
    run measured in minutes.

    **Remote inputs are not covered at all, and the marker is not coverage.** A URL contributes a fixed
    marker, which adds nothing the config hash did not already carry: hashing the bytes would mean
    downloading the catalogue a second time purely to identify the run, and hashing the loader's cache
    would refuse every legitimate resume, because the first run computes this before any cache exists.
    So a re-fetch that returns different bytes between an interrupt and a resume -- ``refresh: true``, a
    cleared cache, a mutable URL -- mixes catalogues exactly as a local swap used to, undetected.
    :func:`report_unverified_inputs` says so at the point it matters instead of leaving the
    docstring to carry it. Pinning the URL to an immutable revision, as the examples do, is the practical
    answer.

    *Only the population file is covered*, deliberately -- the input this was found through. Other paths
    a config can name (PSD files, waveform tables) remain invisible, and would need the same treatment
    if one of them ever bites.

    Args:
        config_hashes: Per-batch ``config_sha256`` values, in plan order. ``None`` entries are kept
            as a literal marker rather than dropped, so a plan with an unhashed batch does not
            fingerprint the same as one without that batch.
        output_directory: Where this run writes its data.
        metadata_directory: Where this run writes its metadata and index.
        referenced_inputs: Files whose *content* is part of this run's identity. Duplicates and order
            are normalised away: every batch carries the population config, so a three-batch plan
            presents the same path three times, and adding a batch must not change the input part of
            the identity. A path that cannot be read contributes a marker naming it, which still
            differs from the same path read successfully -- so a run that could not hash its input is
            never mistaken for one that did.

        A hex digest identifying the run.

    ``~`` is expanded, because the loader expands it before reading. Without that, a config naming
    ``~/population.csv`` failed to open here and recorded the same "could not hash" marker whatever the
    file held -- so the guard silently did nothing for exactly the paths people write by hand. Found in
    review, and the reason this function does not simply take a ``Path``.

    **For a CSV**, line endings are normalised and trailing blank lines dropped before hashing. The run
    consumes the *parsed* catalogue, so a regenerated file differing only in CRLF/LF or a trailing newline
    yields an identical population -- and refusing that resume costs a long run for no reason. Population
    files are machine-generated, so same-content regeneration is a normal workflow rather than a rare
    edit. This is not full parsing: a reordered or reformatted CSV still refuses, the safe direction.

    **For anything else** -- ``.hdf5``, ``.h5`` -- the bytes are hashed exactly as they are. In a binary
    catalogue ``\r`` and ``\n`` are values, and normalising them made two different populations hash
    alike, which is the failure this guard exists to prevent.

    A remote reference is a marker rather than a fetch: identifying the run is not worth downloading the
    catalogue twice. **This means remote populations get no content coverage at all** -- the marker adds
    nothing the config hash did not already carry, and a re-fetch that returns different bytes between an
    interrupt and a resume is undetected. :func:`report_unverified_inputs`, called from the resume path, says so at
    ``INFO`` -- it cannot tell a pinned URL from a mutable one, so it informs rather than warns.

    An unreadable reference is a marker too, not an exception. This runs before the plan executes, so a
    population staged later or a path typo has to reach its own error rather than a traceback from the
    identity check -- and the marker still differs from a successful digest, so "could not hash" is never
    confused with "hashed".

    """Manages checkpoint files for simulation recovery.

    A checkpoint is created after each successfully completed batch,
    allowing resumption from that point if the simulation is interrupted.

    Checkpoint file format:
    {
        "completed_batch_indices": [0, 1, 2, ...],
        "last_simulator_name": "signal",
        "last_completed_batch_index": 2,
        "simulator_tails": {           # one entry per simulator that has completed a batch
            "signal": {
                "batch_index": 2,
                "state": {...},
                "spillover": ...       # chunks continuing into the next segment, or null
            }
        },
        "config_sha256": "..."  # which configuration produced this run; a resume refuses a null
    }

    **One tail per simulator, not one per checkpoint.** A plan can execute several simulators, and a
    single ``last_simulator_state``/``last_simulator_spillover`` pair holds whichever of them
    finished last: the earlier simulator's state, and the tail of any signal crossing its final
    segment boundary, were overwritten and gone. Scoping the hand-over stops that tail reaching the
    *wrong* simulator, but nothing can recover a tail the file never kept. Those two keys are
    therefore no longer written; :meth:`load_checkpoint` rebuilds them from the tail of
    ``last_simulator_name`` so callers asking for "the last one" keep working, and reads them back
    as a single tail when a checkpoint written by an older gwmock has no ``simulator_tails``.

    The checkpoint is written atomically:
    1. Write to .tmp file
    2. Backup existing checkpoint to .bak
    3. Rename .tmp to checkpoint file
    This ensures we never have a corrupted checkpoint.

                serialized into every batch metadata record, and those are provenance documents
                meant to stay small and readable; spillover is raw samples, megabytes of them for a

                measured at 1 frame written where a clean run writes 3, exit code 0, no warning.

            simulator_tails: Tails already recorded for the *other* simulators of this run, carried
                forward so completing a batch of one simulator does not erase another's. The entry
                for ``last_simulator_name`` is rebuilt from the four arguments above, so a caller may
                pass the whole mapping it accumulates rather than having to exclude the current one.

                Without this the file holds one tail: a plan running simulator A then B keeps only
                B's, so A's state and the tail of any signal crossing A's last boundary are gone --
                and unlike a *misapplied* tail, which scoping refuses, nothing can recover one that
