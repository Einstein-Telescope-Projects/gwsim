"""Turn gwmock-signal's batched device output into gwmock chunks.

The batched entry point returns ``strain`` of shape ``(n_events, n_detectors, n_samples)`` --
per-event and *unsuperposed*, with placement left to the caller. gwmock already has an assembler for
exactly that: ``TimeSeries.inject_from_list`` places chunks by absolute time, caches whatever
overflows a segment, and carries it into the next one. So the device does generation and projection,
and gwmock keeps the incremental, checkpointed assembly it already owns.

That split is deliberate rather than a compromise. Generation was measured at 9.67e-3 s per second
of data against 3.66e-4 for assembly, so the expensive 96% moves to the device while the part that
owns spill-over, resumability and memory bounds stays where it works.

Peak host memory is one full copy of the batch. ``np.asarray(batch.strain)`` materialises
``(n_events, n_detectors, n_samples)`` at once, and gwmock-signal's ``chunk_size`` bounds the work
done per generation call without bounding the size of the result handed back. That is acceptable
here because the intended caller is ``_simulate``, which runs once per segment and so passes only
the events belonging to that segment -- but it is not a safe path for a whole catalogue in one call,
and nothing in this module enforces that. A caller batching more than one segment at a time needs
its own bound.

Placement is required to be **on the output lattice**. When ``simulate_cbc_batch`` is given an
``output_grid``, each buffer starts exactly on a sample of that grid, so injection is an
integer-offset add. Without it, buffers begin at an arbitrary time and gwmock has to interpolate
every chunk onto the segment grid -- which costs a resample per chunk and is, in gwmock-signal's own
words, "accurate only for heavily oversampled strain". This module refuses that case rather than
letting it degrade quietly.

#: population using ``distance`` -- as the bundled BBH catalogue does -- works per-event and fails
#: batched, which would make switching execution mode change whether a config runs at all. Taken
#: from gwmock-signal's backends rather than invented, so the two agree on what an alias is.
#:
#: Scope: this covers the aliases LAL and ripple share, plus PyCBC's ``lambda1``/``lambda2``. It is a
#: fourth copy of a mapping gwmock-signal already holds three times, one per backend, and the right
#: home for it is a canonicalisation helper there. Until that exists, a config using an alias no
#: backend shares would still be refused by the batched path with a missing-parameter error naming
#: the canonical name.

#: Canonical parameters the batched path actually consumes.

#: Projection reads the first four; ripple's waveform generation reads the rest. Anything else
#: handed to ``simulate_cbc_batch`` is ignored without complaint, which for a *fixed* argument the
#: user wrote in their config is a silent drop -- the third of that kind found in this work. Listed
#: here so it can be rejected instead.
#:
#: Taken from ``gwmock_signal.jax_batch`` and ``waveform.backends.ripple``. It will drift if
#: gwmock-signal grows a parameter; the cost of that is a spurious rejection, which is visible,
#: rather than a silent omission, which is not.
#:
#: The in-plane spins are here because ripple's batch resolver reads all six components for the
#: precessing approximants (``IMRPhenomPv2``, ``IMRPhenomXP``, ``IMRPhenomXPHM``). Omitting them
#: rejected every precessing configuration -- the opposite failure to a silent drop, and the reason
#: this list is checked against the library rather than written from memory.
#:
#: ``f_ref`` is deliberately *absent*. It is a backend option, not a per-event parameter:
#: gwmock-signal's own ``_RESERVED_WAVEFORM_ARGUMENTS`` says "f_ref is configured on the backend,
#: not through waveform_arguments". Passing it in this mapping does nothing at all. The
#: orchestrator forwards it to the ripple backend instead, so the configuration key still works.
