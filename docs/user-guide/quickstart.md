# Quick Start

This guide will help you run your first gwmock simulation in just a few minutes.

## 1. Run Your First Simulation

Run the following command in your working directory:

```bash
# Copy quick-start configuration file to working directory
gwmock config --get noise/uncorrelated_gaussian/quick_start --output quick_start_config.yaml

# Run simulation
gwmock simulate quick_start_config.yaml
```

<!-- typos:off -->

The configuration file `quick_start_config.yaml` runs the full orchestration
pipeline — population sampling, CBC signal injection, and noise generation —
producing a 1024-second dataset for the ET Sardinia configuration.

It requires an internet connection to fetch the BBH population file from GitHub.

<!-- typos:on -->

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note
    The quick-start fetches a population file on first run.
    Ensure you have internet access and approximately 50 MB of free disk space.

You should see output like:

```text
INFO Config mode: quick_start_config.yaml
INFO Configuration loaded and validated
INFO Created simulation plan with 1 batches
INFO Simulation plan validation passed
INFO Executing simulation plan: 1 batches
INFO Executing 1 simulators
Executing simulation plan:   0%|                                        | 0/1
Executing simulation plan: 100%|████████████████████████████████████████| 1/1
INFO Simulation completed successfully. Output written to output
```

## 2. Check the Output

Your working directory will contain:

```text
output/
├── noise/
│   ├── E-ET1_SARD_STRAIN_NOISE-1577491218-1024.hdf5
│   ├── E-ET2_SARD_STRAIN_NOISE-1577491218-1024.hdf5
│   └── E-ET3_SARD_STRAIN_NOISE-1577491218-1024.hdf5
└── signal/
    ├── E-ET1_SARD_STRAIN_BBH-1577491218-1024.hdf5
    ├── E-ET2_SARD_STRAIN_BBH-1577491218-1024.hdf5
    └── E-ET3_SARD_STRAIN_BBH-1577491218-1024.hdf5
metadata/
├── index.yaml
└── orchestration-0.metadata.json
resource_usage_summary.json
```

The `ET-Triangle-Sardinia` network alias expands to its three interferometers
(`ET1_SARD`, `ET2_SARD`, `ET3_SARD`), so one frame file per interferometer is
written for both noise and signal.

### Data Files

`output/noise/` contains the simulated Gaussian noise strain. `output/signal/`
contains the injected CBC signal strain. To produce a realistic data stream,
merge the two using GWpy (see [Reading Data](reading-data.md)).

### Metadata File

The `.metadata.json` file records the exact configuration, seeds, and package
versions needed to reproduce this run. For details on the schema and how to
reuse metadata files, see the [Metadata Files](metadata.md) and
[Reproducibility](reproducibility.md) pages.

## 3. Explore Different Simulators

To run any gwmock simulations, you only need to provide a `.yaml` configuration
file. A collection of ready-to-use configuration files is available in the
[`gwmock/examples`](https://github.com/Leuven-Gravity-Institute/gwmock/tree/main/examples)
directory. You can use them directly or adapt them to suit your needs.

- For an overview of all available examples, see the [Examples](examples.md)
  page.
- For a more complete and user-friendly guide to writing your own configuration
  files, see the [Configuration Files](configuration.md) page.
